    This class defines the necessary methods for managing nonces as
    part of the digest-auth protocol:

        * generate_nonce:     create a new unique nonce
        * is_valid_nonce:     check for validity of a nonce
        * get_next_nonce:     get next nonce to be used by client
        * get_prandom_bytes:  get some pseudo-random bytes linked to a nonce
        * set_nonce_count:    record nonce counter sent by client
        * get_nonce_count:    retrieve nonce counter sent by client

    Nonce management is split out into a separate class to make it easy
    to adjust the various time-vs-memory-security tradeoffs involved -
    for example, you might provide a custom NonceManager that stores its
    state in memcache so it can be shared by several servers.

       * timeout: the time after which a nonce will expire.

       * soft_timeout:  the time after which an updated nonce will

                        nonce signature; if not specified then it
                        defaults to just the user-agent string.
